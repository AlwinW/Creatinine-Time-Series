# Abstract

## Aim

New Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) technology provides accurate and validated
point-of-care creatinine measurement. Such technology makes it possible to
detect small, short-term increases in creatinine levels. These changes alone
however lack clinical context. We aimed to improve the predictive value of
small, short-term creatinine increases for the development of Acute Kidney
Injury (AKI) in critically ill patients by incorporating clinically available
information.

## Methods

In this prospective cohort study, we assessed all the creatinine values from
ABGs and laboratory biochemistry results in critically ill patients. We
calculated the small, short-term creatinine increases between creatinine values
during the patient’s Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission until the development
of KDIGO-defined AKI or ICU discharge or death, whichever occurred first. We
evaluated the predictive value of these creatinine increases over varying time
periods for AKI development in multivariable analysis with known risk factors,
co-morbidities and other clinically available data.

## Results

**TO BE FIXED UP**

We screened a convenience sample of 830 patients and excluded 443 (53.4%)
patients [AKI on admission (208; 47%), weekend admission (91; 21%) and other
pre-defined exclusion criteria (144; 32%)]. The 387 (46.6%) eligible patients
had 3,974 creatinine measurements on ABGs and biochemistry results, which
generated 71,499 creatinine change episodes, excluding creatinine measurements
after AKI development. In multivariable modelling, creatinine increases of
≥1 µmol/L/h over 6 to 7 hours had an odds ratio of 3.14 (95% CI 1.82 – 5.43) for
the development of AKI in 8 to 16 hours after the creatinine increase. The
multivariable model with these creatinine increases had an 81.5% sensitivity,
74.2% specificity and 0.85 area under the curve for AKI development in 8 to 16
hours.

## Conclusion

In combination with known risk factors, frequent creatinine assessment to detect
small, short-term creatinine increases provides a novel and rapid method of
predicting AKI in critically ill patients.
